### [JSL11] Agile Board - Kanban Task Management App


### Project Overview
The Agile Board project serves as the culminating experience for the JSL course, providing an immersive opportunity for aspiring junior developers to immerse themselves in the development process. As a junior developer, the project tasks you with breathing life into a Kanban Task Management App. This involves both resolving existing bugs in the code and creating new functions to expand the application's capabilities. The project encompasses a range of activities, including importing utility functions, initializing data, and delving into debugging tasks such as configuring data in local storage, dynamically presenting boards and tasks, and enhancing user interactions.

Furthermore, the project delves into enhancing the application by crafting code to fulfill specific functionalities outlined in the user stories. These functionalities include managing task details and their lifecycle, implementing theme customization, and ensuring the persistence of data through local storage. This amalgamation of debugging and creative coding presents an opportunity to apply critical thinking and problem-solving skills in a practical manner, preparing participants for the complexities of real-world software development scenarios.

# Challenges Faced

**Identifying and Resolving Bugs:**
During the development of the task management app, one of the primary challenges I encountered was uncovering and addressing various bugs within the code. Many of these bugs surfaced during the process of making the app functional, requiring careful attention and troubleshooting. However, through perseverance and thorough debugging efforts, I successfully resolved all identified bugs, ensuring the smooth operation of the application.

**Implementing the `toggleTheme()` Function:**
The `toggleTheme()` function presented another significant challenge, particularly in relation to persisting user preferences. Specifically, I encountered difficulty in effectively setting the `isLightTheme` variable in localStorage to remember the user's selected theme, whether dark or light. Overcoming this obstacle it involved attention to details and a deep dive into local storage functionalities to ensure seamless retention of user preferences across sessions.

**Managing `toggleTheme()` Functionality Across Sessions:**
Furthermore, within the `toggleTheme()` function, an additional challenge arose in the management of the `isLightMode` sideLogoDiv source in local storage. This presented a crucial aspect of user experience, as it aimed to preserve the appropriate sideLogoDiv source in line with the selected theme, even after the user refreshed the tab. This challenge involved implementing robust storage mechanisms to accurately retain the user's preferred theme and associated visual `isLightTheme`, contributing to a seamless and consistent user experience.


# ðŸ“š What I Learned:
Through the Agile Board project, I gained invaluable experience in debugging and enhancing code functionality. This project provided an opportunity to refine my skills in identifying and rectifying bugs, as well as developing new functions to meet specific user story requirements. Importantly, I honed my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities, The hands-on nature of the project equipped me with practical knowledge that is directly applicable to real-world scenarios, offering a meaningful glimpse into the demands of professional software development.

In overcoming these challenges, I gained valuable insights into the intricate details of code functionality, local storage management, and user experience considerations. Each obstacle served as an opportunity for growth, allowing me to refine my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of effective code implementation and data persistence strategies.
